////The return value specifies the size of the returned information in bytes. If the infor­mation is not supported, the function returns zero. If a tablet is not physi­cally pres­ent, this function always returns zero.
////Comments
////Several important categories of information are available through this function. First, the function provides identification information, including specification and software version numbers, and tablet vendor and model information. Sec­ond, the function provides general capability information, including dimensions, resolutions, optional features, and cursor types. Third, the function provides categories that give defaults for all tablet context attributes. Finally, the func­tion may provide any other implementation- or vendor-specific information cat­egories necessary.
////The information returned by this function is subject to change during a Win­dows session.

////BOOL WTMgrCsrButtonMap(hMgr, wCursor, lpLogBtns, lpSysBtns)
////This function allows tablet managers to change the button mappings for each cursor type. Each cursor type has two button maps. The logical button map as­signs physi­cal buttons to logical buttons (applications only use logical buttons). The system cursor button map binds system-button functions to logical buttons.
////Parameter
////Type
////Description
////hMgr
////HMGR Is the valid manager handle that identifies the caller as a manager application.
////wCursor
////UINT Specifies the zero-based cursor id of the cursor type whose button maps are being set.
////lpLogBtns
////LPBYTE Points to a 32 byte array of logical button numbers, one for each physical button. If the value WTP_LPDEFAULT is specified, the function resets the default value for the logical but­ton map.
////lpSysBtns
////LPBYTE Points to a 32 byte array of button action codes, one for each logical button. If the value WTP_LPDEFAULT is speci­fied, the function resets the default value for the system button map.
////Return Value
////The return value is non-zero if the new settings have taken effect. Otherwise, it is zero.
////Comments
////The function will allow two or more physical buttons to be assigned to one logi­cal button. Likewise, it does not ensure that left and right system button events can be properly generated. It is up to the tablet manager to make sure that ap­propriate limi­tations are applied to the logical button map and that the system buttons are not left disabled.

////hMgr
////HMGR Is the valid manager handle that identifies the caller as a manager application.
////wCsr
////UINT Specifies the zero-based cursor id of the cursor type whose pressure button marks are being set.
////dwNMarks
////DWORD Specifies the button marks for the normal pressure but­ton. The low order word contains the release mark; the high order word contains the press mark. If the value WTP_DWDEFAULT is specified, the function resets the default value for the marks.
////dwTMarks
////DWORD Specifies the button marks for the tangent pressure but­ton. The low order word contains the release mark; the high order word contains the press mark. If the value WTP_DWDEFAULT is specified, the function resets the default value for the marks.

////Parameter
////Type
////Description
////hMgr
////HMGR Is the valid manager handle that identifies the caller as a manager application.
////wCsr
////UINT Specifies the zero-based cursor id of the cursor whose pressure response curves are being set.
////lpNResp
////UINT FAR * Points to an array of UINTs describing the pressure response curve for normal pressure. If the value WTP_LPDEFAULTis specified, the function resets the default value for the response curve.
////lpTResp
////UINT FAR * Points to an array of UINTs describing the pressure response curve for tangential pressure. If the value WTP_LPDEFAULT is specified, the function resets the default value for the response curve.
////Return Value
////The return value is non-zero if the new settings have taken effect. Otherwise, it is zero.
////Comments
////The pressure response curves represent a transfer function mapping physical pres­sure values to logical pressure values (applications see only logical pressure values). Each array element contains a logical pressure value corresponding to some physi­cal pressure value. The array indices are "stretched" evenly over the input range.
////The number of entries in the arrays depends upon the range of physical pressure values. The number will be the number of physical values or 256, whichever is smaller. When there is an entry for each possible value, the value is used as an in­dex to the array, and the corresponding array element is returned. When there are more values that array elements, the physical value is mapped to a 0-255 scale. The result is used as the index to look up the logical pressure value.

////Parameter
////Type
////Description
////hMgr
////HMGR Is the valid manager handle that identifies the caller as a manager application.
////wCsr
////UINT Specifies the zero-based cursor id of the cursor type whose pressure button marks are being set.
////lpNMarks
////UINT FAR * Points to a two-element array containing the button marks for the normal pressure button. The first unsigned integer contains the release mark; the second unsigned integer contains the press mark. If the value WTP_LPDEFAULT is specified, the function resets the default value for the marks.
////lpTMarks
////UINT FAR * Points to a two-element array containing the button marks for the tangent pressure button. The first unsigned integer contains the release mark; the second unsigned integer contains the press mark. If the value WTP_LPDEFAULT is specified, the function resets the default value for the marks.
////Return Value
////The return value is non-zero if the new settings have taken effect. Otherwise, it is zero.
////Comments
////This function allows the tablet manager to let the user control the "feel" of the pres­sure buttons when they are used as conventional buttons.
////The pressure ranges are defined such that the minimum value of the range indi­cates the resting, unpressed state, and the maximum value indicates the fully pressed state. The button marks determine the pressure at which button press and release events are generated. When the button is logically up and pressure rises above the press mark, a button press event is generated. Conversely, when the but­ton is logi­cally down and pressure drops below the release mark, a button release event is generated.
////The marks should be set far enough apart so that the button does not "jitter," yet far enough from the ends of the range so that the button events are easy to gen­erate.
////The marks are valid if and only if the button press mark is greater than the but­ton release mark. Setting the marks to invalid combinations will turn off button-event generation for the button.
